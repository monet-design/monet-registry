This README introduces the project, highlights the open-source spirit, and helps you get hands-on quickly.

## Why Monet?

- **540+ curated components**: 14+ categories covering landing, marketing, and dashboard patterns.
- **Next.js & TypeScript ready**: Accessible, production-grade patterns built for modern stacks.
- **Unified flow**: Search → preview → install in one place.

## What’s in this repo

- A Next.js + Tailwind CSS starter that showcases Monet-inspired sections.
- Guidance on pairing Monet components with shadcn-ui, Lucide icons, and es-toolkit utilities.
- Editable examples in `src/app/page.tsx` you can swap or extend.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open `http://localhost:3000` to view a Monet-styled demo page.

## How to use it
